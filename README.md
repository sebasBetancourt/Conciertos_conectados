# Connected Concerts - Phase 1

## Description

**Connected Concerts** is a web application that allows users to explore, purchase, and manage tickets for concerts and music events. The application was developed using **HTML** and **pure CSS**, with a focus on mobile device visualization, especially for iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 Pro, using the **Mobile Simulator** extension to simulate the experience on these devices.

The platform offers an intuitive experience, allowing users to search for events by category, get detailed information about each event, and efficiently purchase tickets.
